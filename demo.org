* Is people familiar with FlowStorm?

** What is it?

Editor/IDE independent recording and visualization of Clojure programs :

  - execution
  - data (like portal, morse, etc)
    
with interactive programming in mind (for dev, a repl companion)

** How can it help me?

      - With debugging
      - Learning/Understanding, from simple functions to entire systems, from a runtime perspective
      - With iterative/interactive development by value capture (like snitch, etc)
      - Visualizing complex and possibly real time changing data
      - Enhancing static code reading by providing more details like values shapes     

* Demos

- Ergonomics in 4.2.2 (global setup)
- Basics simple.clj (, , libs, loops, def, def all frame vars)
  - jumping around stepping, calltree, fns list
  - exceptions
  - libs, loops, def, def all frame vars (encode!)
- Web apps
- Plugins      
- Programmable debugging
- Data windows    
- Other plugins (async-flow, cljs-compiler)
